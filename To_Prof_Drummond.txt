Dear Professor Drummond,

I have been working on the project and I have come across several questions. 

First, I have calculated the composition and some other variables of amino acids of the P-domain in multiple sequences. Now I don't know how to carry out the further analysis and present the results.  

Second, I want to ask the standard when we classify the amino acids according to their hydrophobicity because there are so many standards when I search. Now I use the standard of the color scheme in Jalview which is from a paper in 1982. When I look at the table, I also feel confused. According to the table, Cys(C) which is known as hydrophilic amino acid is more hydrophobic than Met(M) and Ala(A). Is that standard reliable?

Third, Jamie used BLAST to find the nucleotide and amino acid sequence of Pab1 in O.parapolymorpha. When I compare its P-domain with the sequence you sent to me in the fasta file of multiple sequence, I found there are three different amino acids in 129 amino acids. 
from BLAST:

from fasta file:

VFNEYPQNGRMPQQRYYQGGRPGQQPPQAGPRGKSEDGAVPSLAQVLPQFPP

Although it didn't affect the mutation, I still want to ask which one I should use for sequence analysis and is it common to see such differences in one species?

Have a good day!

Best,
